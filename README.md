# Sid-s-TodoList
Sid's Todo List is a feature-rich, fully responsive task management web application built using modern HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript. Designed with both functionality and user experience in mind, it provides a seamless interface for organizing, editing, and tracking tasks efficiently.

This project goes beyond basic CRUD operations by integrating a wide range of enhancements such as:

⏱️ Live time display for an interactive feel

🔍 Real-time search filtering to quickly find tasks

📝 Inline editing for efficient task updates

📊 Dynamic task statistics (total, completed, pending)

🌗 Custom dark/light theme toggle for accessibility

📤 Export functionality for saving todos as .json

🧹 Clear all option and smart empty-state messaging

🎯 3D animations and transitions to enhance user engagement

All user data is persistently stored in localStorage, ensuring tasks are retained across browser sessions without the need for a backend.

The layout is fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop using media queries, and the UI is crafted with clean, modern typography and iconography. This project not only demonstrates strong command over core web technologies but also showcases an attention to detail, design thinking, and user-centric development.
